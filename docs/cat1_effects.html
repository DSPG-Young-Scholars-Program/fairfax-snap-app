<p>When looking at potential at-risk tracts in this income category, we
examine the tracts with the top 5 highest monthly benefit losses per
household and per person. We filter our data to exclude tracts with 5 or
fewer households represented in order to consider changes that could
impact as many people as possible.</p>
