## What is SNAP?

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest federal nutrition assistance program.  Formerly known as Food Stamps, SNAP helps families to afford a basic diet. 

Participants may use SNAP benefits in supermarkets, grocery stores, convenience stores and food retailers to purchase food.

## Eligibility

[General Overview of SNAP Rules](https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/a-quick-guide-to-snap-eligibility-and-benefits)

SNAP is 100% federally funded but administrative costs are largely paid for by states/counties. Counties will occasionally supplement SNAP funding as well. SNAP is county-administered specifically in Virginia.

Under federal rules, to be eligible for benefits a household’s income and resources must meet *three tests*:  


**Gross monthly income** - that is, household income before any of the program’s deductions are applied — generally must be at or below 130 percent of the poverty line. The poverty level is higher for bigger families and lower for smaller families.  
**Net income** - household income after deductions are applied must be at or below the poverty line.  
**Assets** must fall below certain limits: households without a member who is age 60 or older or who has a disability must have assets of $2,750.  

However, due to *Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility*, Virginia, Maryland, and DC have a **gross monthly income limit at 200% of poverty level and no asset limits**

## New Policy Change for Emergency Benefits

On **March 1st** people residing in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington D.C. will no longer receive the emergency SNAP allotment that was available during the COVID pandemic. These emergency benefits allowed any SNAP-eligible person to receive either the maximum possible allotment (shown in the table above), or their predicted benefit + $95. We aim to examine the effects of this policy change, as there are people in need who [face rising costs and will receive less money for food](https://wjla.com/news/local/dc-snap-recipients-face-lingering-high-costs-as-emergency-benefits-end-march-1-emergency-allotment-washington-maryland-virginia-capital-area-food-bank-assistance-money-inflation-hunger-economy#)
